# guidance-control-and-navigation
explaning the approach that I took: 
used ardupilot as fidht controller
used IRIS drone as model to work with
Sensor addition on drone : camera and lidar
for obstacle avoidance and navigation tried to implement reactive obstacle avoidance where we consider the destination waypoint and drone as oppositely charged charges which attract and the obstacles and drone are treated as like charges (concept explained in detail in the following paper:http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~mir/pub/ObstacleAvoidance.pdf).
